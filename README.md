# Theory-of-Algorithims-Project
This is my solution to the project that we have gotten for Theory of Algorithims.

### What we needed to do
In this project you must write a program in the C programming language to calculate the SHA512 value of an input file. Your program must take the name or path of the file as a command line argument and output the SHA512 digest of it. The program must be coded from scratch - you cannot use any external libraries other than what is included in the C standard library. Your program must compile using gcc or clang and you must include a Makefile which compiles it upon make being called in the project folder. You must also include tests which run upon make test being called, as will be described in lectures. You should also include in your repository an appropriate .gitignore file and a README.md as described below.

## Answers to questions
#### Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?
...
#### Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?
...
#### How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?
...
